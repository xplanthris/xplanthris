## Hi there!
Hey there, my name is Syed Muhammad Shuja Haider, also known as xplanthris and I'm a 13 year old idiot. I live in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.<br>
I enjoy programming, hacking, reverse engineering, and much more on what is essentially an overglorified metal box.<br>
I've been programming since I was 6 years old and safe to say, I've gotten pretty good at it.<br>
My favorite languages are probably C / C++, ASM, Java.<br>
